title: About

I am a graduate student at San Diego State University pursuing an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics with an emphasis in Dynamical Systems and Chaos. 

For my thesis research I am studying local scale selection in imaging motivated from a functional analysis point of view (Triebel-Lizorkin function spaces). Scale-space representation of images has been useful in imaging tasks such as edge, blob, and ridge detection. More hands-on applications include 3D reconstruction of coral reefs, autonomous vehicle navigation and facial feature recognition. 

I am also a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Cooperative Science Center in Atmospheric Sciences and Meteorology (NCAS-M) Research Fellow. Here I am implementing data sets, e.g. NOAA Global Ocean Data Assimilation System, to compute deep ocean temperature anomalies and predict El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (EN-SO) phenomena by use of machine learning algorithms.

Other of my interests and hobbies include traveling, swimming and drumming.
